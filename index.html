			<p> BO4 or formally know as Call of Duty Black Ops 4, it is part of the gaming line of all Call of Duty's made by Activision. They have all had a common genre of shooter. The games modes span from a survival mode called zombies were you try and fight off zombies as long as you can, to a new game mode called blackout where players will have to scavenge, strategise, compete and survive to win. It features the largest map that's ever been built in Call of Duty.</p>

		<div class="item2">
			<p> Fortnite battle royal on the other hand is a fairly new game coming out only last fall as a complete game mode. It has almost the same format as Blackout except for one thing, the animated graphics. The game was made for a child based audience but has unfortunately infected almost all gamers, young and old.
